This repository stores documents of Airline Passenger Analysis, including reports, Juptyer Notebook, presentations and visualization. 

This includes an analysis conducted for Starluck Airlines (fictional) to evaluate customer satisfaction across various service touchpoints and identify key areas for improvement. Utilizing data from a customer survey, the study categorized the passenger journey into four areas: Digital Experience, Airport Service, Cabin Comfort & Environment, and Inflight Services. Employing predictive models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, the research aimed to determine which factors most strongly influence a customer's overall satisfaction rating. The findings identified Online Check-in as the strongest driver of satisfaction, while Inflight Wi-Fi Service was flagged as the weakest touchpoint requiring urgent attention, despite being highly important to customers. Ultimately, the report provides targeted recommendations for each departmental team to enhance performance and strengthen the airline's competitive position.
